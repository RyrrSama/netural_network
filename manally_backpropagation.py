#NOTE: We need to do manually backprogation to neuron.
#   TODO: Create a Neural Network of simple expression with two inputs(x1, x2) respectively.
#   TODO: Multiple the  synapse(weights w) to the inputs(x1, x2) of the neural networks.
#   TODO: Create a cell body for the Neural Network
#   (sum of all inputs to the neuron with weights multiplied to it cell_body = x1w1+x2w2+...)
